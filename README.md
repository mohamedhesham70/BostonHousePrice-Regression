# BostonHousePrice-Regression
Boston House Price Prediction using Regression Models

This project explores the Boston Housing Dataset to predict house prices using various Machine Learning regression models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using:

âœ… Linear Regression
âœ… Random Forest Regressor
âœ… XGBoost Regressor

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
ðŸ”¹ Performance Metrics: RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)
ðŸ”¹ Next Steps: Hyperparameter tuning & model deployment ðŸš€
